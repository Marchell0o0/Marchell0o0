# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mark

I'm currently a third-year student at **CTU in Prague**, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in **Cybernetics and Robotics**.


## Interests

I’m interested in robotics projects, especially in designing and fine-tuning algorithms for tasks like control, navigation, and sensor integration. While I have experience in areas like computer vision, I’m particularly drawn to low-level robotics programming in C or C++, where I can work on systems that physically move and interact with their environment.

## Skills & Technologies

I have a strong foundation in robotics-related disciplines, including advanced math, control theory, and FPGA/microcontroller programming. I’ve built desktop applications in C++, tutored programming in C, and developed algorithms for SLAM, path tracking, and path planning in Python. Right now, I’m also working on a web app using Flask for the backend and Next.js for the frontend.

## 📦 Projects

- [Software for a turtlebot](https://github.com/Marchell0o0/LAR) - Python code that solves, localization, mapping, pathfinding, path tracking and visualization of a turtle robot and it’s environment, that executes a task described by a university subject. With an [extensive Latex documentation](https://github.com/Marchell0o0/LAR/blob/main/LAR_Technical_Report___O__Borys__M__Horpynych.pdf) describing the solution and the task in detail.
- [Fractal Visualization](https://github.com/Marchell0o0/Fractals) - Desktop C application for fractal rendering and animation with two devices communication functionallity.
- [Backie](https://github.com/Marchell0o0/Backie) - Desktop C++ application for scheduling, management and optimization of backups
- [University Homework Repository](https://github.com/Marchell0o0/CTU_homeworks) - A collection of my university homework, featuring solutions in C, Python, and AI projects.
